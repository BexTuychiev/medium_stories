If there are 100 possible candidates and you are doing 5-fold cross-validation, the given estimator will be trained 500 times (500 iterations) . Surely, this will take excruciatingly long time for heavy models.\n",

    "RandomizedSearch tries to control the number of iterations by making 'smarter' choices about which set of parameters to choose in each iteration. It has an additional `n_iter` parameter which directly controls this process. If there are 1000 candidates and `n_iter` is set to 100, the search will stop after 100th iteration and returns the best results from those 100. This random choosing process results in a much shorter training time but its performance won't be as good as GridSearch. "

    "HGS is like a competition among all candidates (hyperparameter combinations). In the first iteration, HGS trains all candidates on a small proportion of the training data. In the next iteration, only the candidates which performed best are chosen and they will be given more resources to compete. So, with each passing iteration, the 'surviving' candidates will be given more and more resources (training samples) until there is only two sets of best hyperparameters standing.
