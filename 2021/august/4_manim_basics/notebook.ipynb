    "After importing all manim content in the first line, we are defining a scene class with a construct method:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class MyFirstAnimation(Scene):\n",

    "This is the general formula of creating a single animation - you define a custom class that inherits from the [`Scene`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.scene.scene.Scene.html) class and has a `construct` method. `Scene` class is the higher-level building block of Manim which connects all related animations and objects into a single structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we are creating two objects (a star and a circle) that belong to a `Mobject` class (mathematical object). This [`Mobject`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference_index/mobjects.html) class is a base data structure for many built-in mobjects like geometric shapes, vectors, coordinate systems, etc. Basically, everything that is not a scene and animation is a `Mobject`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyFirstAnimation(Scene):\n",
    "    def construct(self):\n",

    "        star = Star(n=5, fill_color=RED, stroke_color=BLUE)\n",
    "        circle = Circle(fill_color=DARK_BLUE, fill_opacity=.8, stroke_color=BLUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we have the [`Animation`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference_index/animations.html) classes. In the above example, we are using 3 of them - `FadeIn`, `Transform` and `FadeOut`. All built-in `Animation` classes in manim accept mobjects as arguments and apply various effects to them. For example, `Transform` accepts two mobjects and plays out a smooth animation that converts the first one to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.play(FadeIn(star, run_time=2))\n",
    "# Wait for a second\n",

    "# Transform star into a circle\n",

    "# Remove the circle by fading it out\n",
    "self.play(FadeOut(circle))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you create an animation, you have to wrap it inside the `play` function so that they are rendered on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we have the constants like `RED`, `BLUE`, `YELLOW`, `PI`, `TAU`, etc. These are part of the [`constants`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.constants.html) module of Manim and encode commonly-used values as variables and are imported in the first line of the snippet:"
