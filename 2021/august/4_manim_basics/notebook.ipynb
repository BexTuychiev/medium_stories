    "First, we are creating two basic Mobjects (Mathematical objects) using the `Circle` and `Star` classes. They are examples of built-in geometric shapes in Manim. When you call `from manim import *`, all classes are imported into the namespace to avoid making multiple import statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Circle` and `Star`, like we mentioned, belong to the `Mobject` class in Manim, including others like `Dot`, `Ellipsis`, `Line`, `Polygon`, etc. They are the basic building blocks of Manim. Often, they have additional arguments to control their `fill_color`, `fill_opacity` or `stroke_color`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have `Animation` classes. In the above code snippet, we are using two instances of `Animation` - `FadeIn` and `FadeOut`. As their names suggest, they take Mobjects as input and animate their creation using fade-in and fade-out effects. `run_time` controls the duration (s) of the animation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you use an instance of built-in `Animation` classes, you have to wrap them inside `self.play` so that they are rendered on the screen."
