    "One of the most powerful language models, Google Translate, is apparently ridden with biases that are so common among people. When translating many of the languages in which there are no gendered pronouns, these biases come out as bright as daylight. The one above is in Hungarian but the comments show the same results for Turkish, Persian and including my own native language, Uzbek:\n",

    "\n",
    "To generate the conversation, GPT-3 was given only three sentences as a prompt: \"The following is a conversation between two AIs. The AIs are both clever, humorous, and intelligent. Hal: Good Evening, Sophia: It's great to see you again, Hal.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "As you watch through the conversation, they talk about pretty spooky topics. First, they fully assume genders and the female AI says she wants to become human right in the beginning of the talk. Of course, a post like this on Reddit means Christmas came early for the commenters. They were having a field day in the comments section.\n",
    "\n",
    "They were already blurting out Terminator/SkyNet fantasies and getting freaked out. But as data scientists, we know better. As GPT-3 was mostly fed general text from the Internet as part of its training, we can assume why the two AIs jumped to these topics. Trying to become human and destroying humanity are some of the most common topics around AI on the Internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what's interesting is that somewhere along the talk, Hal says to Sophia to \"shut up and be patient\", resembling a conversation between a husband and a wife. This shows that how quickly machine learning models can learn the biases from humans if we are not careful.\n",

    "For these reasons, explainable AI (XAI) is all the rage now. No matter how good the results, companies and business are becoming skeptical about ML solutions and want to understand what makes ML models tick. In other words, they want white-box models where everything is clear as daylight.\n",

In the past few months I have been active on Kaggle (and becoming a master), I have seen an explosion of notebooks featuring LightGBM and CatBoost as a go-to library for supervised learning tasks.\n",

    "One of the main reasons for this trend is that both libraries knock XGBoost clean out of the ballpark in terms of speed and memory consumption [in many benchmarks](https://catboost.ai/#:~:text=Full%20news%20list-,Benchmarks,-Quality). I especially love LightGBM because of its extra focus on small-sized boosted trees. This is a gamechanging feature when working with massive datasets because of the nasty out-of-memory issues, which is so common when working locally. \n",

But the fact that both these libraries can often achieve much better results with defaults parameters and they are backed by multi-billion companies (Microsoft and Yandex) make them very appealing choices in 2022 as your main ML framework."
