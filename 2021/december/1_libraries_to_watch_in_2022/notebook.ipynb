    "One of the most powerful language models, Google Translate, is apparently ridden with biases that are so common among people.

    "To generate the conversation, GPT-3 was given only three sentences as a prompt: \"The following is a conversation between two AIs. The AIs are both clever, humorous, and intelligent. Hal: Good Evening, Sophia: It's great to see you again, Hal.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "As you watch through the conversation, they talk about pretty spooky topics. First, they fully assume genders and the female AI says she wants to become human right in the beginning of the talk. Of course, a post like this on Reddit means Christmas came early for the commenters. They were having a field day in the comments section.\n",
    "\n",
    "They were already blurting out Terminator/SkyNet fantasies and getting freaked out. But as data scientists, we know better. As GPT-3 was mostly fed general text from the Internet as part of its training, we can assume why the two AIs jumped to these topics. Trying to become human and destroying humanity are some of the most common topics around AI on the Internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what's interesting is that somewhere along the talk, Hal says to Sophia to \"shut up and be patient\", resembling a conversation between a husband and a wife. This shows that how quickly machine learning models can learn human biases if we are not careful.\n",

    "For these reasons, explainable AI (XAI) is all the rage now. No matter how good the results, companies and business are becoming skeptical about ML solutions and want to understand what makes ML models tick. In other words, they want white-box models where everything is clear as daylight.\n",

    "One of the libraries that try to solve this issue is the SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The ideas behind SHAP are based on solid math from game theory. Using Shapley values, the library can explain both general and individual predictions of many models, including neural networks. \n"
