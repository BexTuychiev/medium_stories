    "Machine Learning has gained so much popularity that it became one of those topics where people suppose you know everything about it. It is now common to use fancy terms like training/fitting a model, train set, validating a model, a cost function and many others without giving a second thought to whether people understand it or not. Sometimes, it feels like you should have been born knowing these things... \n",
