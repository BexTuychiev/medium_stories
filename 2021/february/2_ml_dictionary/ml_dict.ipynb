It is now common to use fancy terms like training/fitting a model, train set, validating a model, a cost function and many others without giving a second thought to whether people understand it or not. Sometimes, it feels like you should have been born knowing these things... \n",

    "One of the first definitions of machine learning appeared in the late 60s:\n",
    "> Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. - Arthur Samuel\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do computers learn without programming? You may have a thousand science e-books on your laptop but does it mean the machine knows something? You can easily check by asking why water is wet and you will get your answer.\n",

    "One of the earliest applications of machine learning was a *spam filter*. By now, spam filters have become so good that you can't even remember the last time you flagged an email as spam, I bet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before fully explaining machine learning, let's talk about how you would write a program to flag spam emails without machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you look at many examples of spams and identify patterns. These can be urgency words like act now, call now, ending soon or any of the [188 words](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/spam-words) that spammers often use. Then, you write rules that check for these indications to detect spams.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, spammers don't sit still and realize their emails aren't getting through so they come up with better techniques to escape filters. As the patterns in spams change, your program becomes a longer list of complex rules that keeps extending endlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/email.jpg'></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a spam filter based on machine learning detects unusually frequent words that come up in spams compared to regular emails (also called 'ham') and starts automatically flagging them. \n",
    "\n",
    "If spammers start to use new patterns and users start to flag them by hand, ML-based program realizes this and starts to filter those type of spams without your intervention. "
