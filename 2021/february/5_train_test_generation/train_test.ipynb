    "Arguably, the first function you learned from Scikit-learn is `train_test_split`. It performs the most basic yet a crucial task: diving the data into train and test sets. You fit the relevant model to the training and test its accuracy on the test set. Sounds simple. But let me tell you, it is not simple. Not simple at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides a whopping amount of 15 different functions to split your data depending on different use-cases. Some of them you never heard of, some of them are used daily. But don't worry, we won't cover all of them here. Instead, we will only focus on the most common and important ones used by scientists ranging from beginner to Kaggle Grandmasters."
