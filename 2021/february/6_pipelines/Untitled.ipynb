    "Data cleaning and preparation is easily the most time-consuming and boring task in machine learning. All ML algorithms are really fussy, some want normalized or standardized features, some want encoded variables and some want both. Then, there is also the issue of missing values which is always there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with them is no fun at all, not to mention the added bonus that comes with repeating the same cleaning operations on all training, validation and test sets. Fortunately, Scikit-learn's `Pipeline` is a major productivity tool to facilitate this process, cleaning up code and collapsing all preprocessing and modeling steps into to a single line of code. Here, check this out:"

When you call `.predict` the same steps are applied to `X_test`, which is really awesome. "
