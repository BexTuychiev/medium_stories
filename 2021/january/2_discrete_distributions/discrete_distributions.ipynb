    "Say, you are looking at the average weight of 50 Olympic athletes. Based on this data alone, can you make valid assumptions about the mean weight of all Olympic athletes? You would probably say \"I would need more data\". In real life, it is often the case. You can never have enough data that fully represents the group you are interested in. You always work with a sample. \n",
