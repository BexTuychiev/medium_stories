    "Copilot autocompletes code snippets, suggests new lines of code and can even write whole functions based on the description provided. According to the GitHub blog, the tool is not just a language-generating algorithm based on user input - it is a virtual pair programmer. It learns and adapts to the user's coding habits, analyzes the available codebase and generates suggestions backed by billions of lines of public code it has been trained on.\n",
