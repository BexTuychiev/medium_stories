    "> The rest of the references to XGBoost algorithms mainly imply the Sklearn-compatible XGBRegressor and XGBClassifier (or similar) estimators.\n",

    "The estimators have the `random_state` parameter similar to Sklearn estimators (the alternative `seed` parameter has been deprecated but still works). However, running XGBoost with default parameters will yield identical results even with different seeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this behavior is that XGBoost induces randomness only when the parameters `subsample` and all other parameters that start with `colsample_*` prefix are used. As the names suggest, these parameters have a lot to do with [random sampling](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-bootstrap-sampling-is-the-badass-tool-of-probabilistic-thinking-5d8c7343fb67?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------) to combat overfitting.\n",

    "\n",

    "- `reg:squaredlogerror`\n",
    "- `reg:gamma`\n",

    "So, the only question is which tree booster should you pass to the `booster` parameter - `gbtree` or `dart`? \n",
    "\n",
    "I won't bother you with the full differences here. The thing you should know is that XGBoost uses an ensemble of decision tree-based models when used with `gbtree` booster. DART trees are an improvement (to be yet validated) where they introduce random dropping the subset of the decision-trees to prevent overfitting.\n",
