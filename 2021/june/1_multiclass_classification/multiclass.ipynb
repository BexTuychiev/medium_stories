    "Even though multi-class classification is not as common, it certainly poses a much bigger challenge than binary classification problems. Many of the well-known strategies for solving multi-class problems breaks down the task into several or multiple (yes, in this case, there is a difference and I will explain) binary classification problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, there is the issue of choosing an evaluation metric which accurately shows the model's performance across all classes. Since we are dealing with multiple binary classifiers, these metrics tend to get pretty complex. Finally, you must do hyperparameter tuning to optimize for a particular metric. Well, how can you do that if you don't know what you are optimizing for in the first place?\n",
