    "I have recently published [my most challenging article](https://towardsdatascience.com/comprehensive-guide-to-multiclass-classification-with-sklearn-127cc500f362?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------) which was on the topic of multiclass classification (MC). The difficulties I have faced along the way were largely due to the excessive number of classification metrics that I had to learn and explain. By the time I finished, I realized that these metrics deserved an article of their own. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, this post will be about the 6 most commonly MC metrics: precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC score, Cohen Kappa score, Matthew's Correlation coefficient and log loss. You will learn how they are calculated, their nuances in Sklearn and how to use them in your own workflow."
