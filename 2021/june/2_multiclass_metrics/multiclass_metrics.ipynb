The difficulties I have faced along the way were largely due to the excessive number of classification metrics that I had to learn and explain. By the time I finished, I realized that these metrics deserved an article of their own. \n",

    "All of the metrics you will be introduced today are associated with confusion matrices in one way or the other. While a 2 by 2 confusion matrix is intuitive and easy to understand, larger confusion matrices can be *truly confusing*. For this reason, it is a good idea to get some exposure to larger, N by N matrices before diving deep into the metrics that are derived from them. "
