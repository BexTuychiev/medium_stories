    "When Pandas package gained public exposure in 2009, SQL had been dominating the data world since 1974. Pandas came with an attractive set of features such as in-built visualization, flexible data handling and became an ultimate data exploration tool. As it started gaining mass popularity, many courses and resources emerged teaching Pandas and comparing it to SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flash-forward to 2021, people are now getting introduced to the Pandas package *first* rather than the universal data language - SQL. Even though SQL is as popular as ever, the flexibility and multi-functionality of Pandas is making it the first choice for beginner data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, why do you need SQL if you know Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Pandas may seem a better choice, SQL still plays a crucial role in day-to-day job of a data scientist. In fact, SQL is the second most in-demand and the third most growing programming language for data science (see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-most-in-demand-skills-for-data-scientists-in-2021-4b2a808f4005)). So, it is a must to add SQL to your CV if you want to get a job in the field. And knowing Pandas, learning SQL should be a breeze, as you will see in this article."
