    "I remember taking my first ML course on Kaggle. I was introduced to Decision Trees and performed my first \"serious\" regression task on the over-used Ames Housing dataset. I was so happy! I even went as far as thinking that Machine Learning was not so hard after all... What a noob!\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out, Decision Trees was like the \"Hello World\" in ML and I had only dipped my pinkie toe into the world of beautiful math and data. Since then, I have learned and improved a lot (or I think I have). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I am not just blindly training my favorite models based on the target. I have moved away from writing template code and started taking data preprocessing more seriously. Because of these changes and many others, my models started achieving robust results, often upwards of 85 point-performance, even with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this article, I will lay out 7 most important things I learned to consistently push my models to squeeze every bit of performance increase. ## TODO"
