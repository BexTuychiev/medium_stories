    "Today, it is common for datasets to have hundreds if not thousands of features. On the surface, this might seem like a good thing ‚Äî more features give more information about each sample. But more often than not, these additional features don‚Äôt provide much value and introduce complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest challenge of Machine Learning is to create models that have robust predictive power by using as few features as possible. But given the massive sizes of today‚Äôs datasets, it is easy to lose the oversight of which features are important and which ones aren‚Äôt.\n",
    "\n",
    "That‚Äôs why there is an entire skill to be learned in the ML field ‚Äî feature selection. Feature selection is the process of choosing a subset of the most important features while trying to retain as much information as possible (An excerpt from the [first article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-variance-thresholding-for-robust-feature-selection-a4503f2b5c3f) in this series)."
