    "The type of the problems classification solves is divided into two: unsupervised and supervised. Unsupervised models are called neural networks and they can be trained on unstructured data such as video, audio and images. In contrast, supervised models work with labeled, tabular data and is part of classic machine learning. The focus of this article is the latter, particularly, we will be exploring what all supervised classification problems have in common: *confusion matrices*."
