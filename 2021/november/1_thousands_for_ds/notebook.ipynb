    "No, this is not a story of how I worked 100 hours a week to achieve my out-of-this world dreams. This is the story of me being an average Joe and lazy for most of the time and stumble upon a golden opportunity. An opportunity, which started as a spectacular failure, slowly changed my life to the point where I was \"doing it\" without even knowing. \n",

    "In August 2020, I was a fresh high-school graduate and already accepted into the best university in my country. Because the tuition fee was too high, I had no choice but get a full scholarship. This required me to pass a math test conducted among the top 100 candidates. Only 30 of them would get the full prize, so I had a one in a three chance. Pretty doable. Besides, I was good at math, with all the contests and competitions during my school years. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think you already guessed where I am going with this. I failed the test. Beautifully. I came in the top 100 (there were 103 people present). After that, I had two options. One - get a menial job to pay for my tuition and second - try the same thing next year by studying my a** off. Both options would shatter my ambitious dream of learning data science, which already became my passion at that time. \n",

    "What matters are the long-term benefits data science writing bring to your career. Let me first elaborate on how writing is the best way to learn something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, I use a loose analogy I came up. When you learn something new, it is still fresh in your mind, different concepts floating around without being strongly connected to your long term memory. It is kind of like carbon atoms in CO2 gases, floating freely in the air. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you give carbon atoms a structure or apply enough pressure, they turn into a diamond. Writing about the things you learn is, in a sense, similar to turning your initial knowledge into a diamond by giving structure to those new concepts and your thoughts. After all, there is nothing more valuable than knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, data science writing is much more beneficial for beginner learners than for other more experienced folks. When you write during the early stages of your career, the learning potential is great. You spend your time efficiently by both learning and practicing through your posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you start writing later, say after getting a job, there is a chance you might start seeing it as a chore, as a second job. You won't get as much excitement as a beginner because you would be writing about the things you already knew and used thousands of times. \n",
    "\n",
    "And it is going to put strain on your personal life because you would be spending your free time writing rather than enjoying it after a tough day at work. Of course, the articles you write will be well appreciated because of your experience level but it is something you should consider."
