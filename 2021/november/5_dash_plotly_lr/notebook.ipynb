I suggest you go [there](https://dash.plotly.com/#:~:text=Dash%20App%20Gallery-,Dash%20Tutorial,-Installation) as the next step. I also recommend you check out the [example gallery](https://dash.gallery/Portal/) where you can see and enjoy some very cool projects built with Dash. Best part is that many of them are open-source, meaning you can learn much from their source codes. Thanks for reading!"
