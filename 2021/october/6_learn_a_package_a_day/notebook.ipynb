    "Among productivity guru's, there is a term called \"flow state\". It happens when you concentrate on what you are doing so hard that you go into some type of a trance. You can't keep your fingers away from the keyboard. They start working on their accord producing best quality code without thinking for hours at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are doing what's called \"deep work\" - a period of time where you are most productive and creative. The more times you go into a flow during a week, the more high quality work you produce. The only requirement - no distractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the smallest stuff such as checking your email, peeking at your notifications or the most important of all for us programmers - googling something. They are all frictions. They *kill* creativity and *disrupt* your thought process. Deep work is like sleep - once you wake up, you can't just continue where you left off. You have to get back to sleep. Once again. \n",

    "Today, I rarely go to Sklearn or pandas documentation. I know the structure and API design of these libraries inside out as a user. Even if I forget a class name, or a parameter, I know the relevant shortcuts of Jupyterlab and PyCharm that show me what I need in a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "How did I become *this good* at these libraries (and many others libraries, for that matter)? I invested quality hours into each using a proven learning framework I designed. Using this framework, you can learn any small-to-medium sized libraries in a few hours or a day or two if the library is large. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the article, I will outline each step of the framework in detail. By the end, you will have a robust formula for learning any new package you encounter deeply so that you rarely have to go back to the documentation. "
