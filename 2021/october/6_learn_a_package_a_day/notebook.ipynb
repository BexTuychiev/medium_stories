    "Among productivity guru's, there is a term called \"flow state\". It happens when you concentrate on what you are doing so hard that you go into some type of a trance. You can't keep your fingers away from the keyboard. They start working on their accord producing you best quality code without thinking for hours at a time. \n",

    "Even the smallest stuff such as checking your email, peeking at your notifications or the most important of all for us programmers - googling something. They are all frictions. They *kill* creativity and *disrupt* your thought process. Deep work is like sleep - once you wake up, you can't just continue where you left off. You have to get back to sleep. Once again. \n",

    "\n",
    "How did I become *this good* at these libraries (and many others libraries, for that matter)? I invested quality hours into each using a proven learning framework I designed. Using this framework, you can learn any small-to-medium sized libraries in a few hours or a day or two if the library is large. \n",

    "Throughout the article, I will outline each step of the framework in detail. By the end, you will have a robust formula for learning any new package deeply so that you rarely have to go back to the documentation. "
