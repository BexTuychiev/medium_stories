    "Let me check out some of these gold notebooks. Whoa, it is written by a grandmaster. THAT sounds luxurious. The guy seems to know so damn much. I've never seen a data scientist so cool. Let's see his profile - yep, he is a rocket scientist.\n",

    "All you have to do is to make a single submission to a competition and earn your contributor badge. Almost 40% of all Kaggle users are contributors and even larger proportion are novices.\n",

    "Sure, if you are a complete beginner there is no shame in taking a few of [Kaggle's official courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) to get your skills up to scratch. Yes, you will have to work harder than others but it will be absolutely worth it. At this stage, it is important not to compare yourself to others so that you won't lose motivation. \n",
