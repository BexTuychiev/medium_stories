    "R has a rich ecosystem of data manipulation libraries. Be it dplyr, tidyr, or data.table, R users don't have much to complain about in this regard. However, they might consider switching to some Python alternatives for more flexibility, speed and more features. \n",

    "R users will find out that we, Python data scientists, totally revere the Pandas library. It is the king of data manipulation in the Python data science stack and is used by millions around the world. It has [over 20 million weekly downloads](https://pypistats.org/packages/pandas), making it one of the most popular Python packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "It offers such an extensive suite of functions and classes to work with data that you can barely scratch the surface even after using it for a couple of years. Pandas is also a keystone library in the ecosystem as many other dominant Python libraries are written so that their functionality aligns with Pandas' classes. \n",

    "If Pandas sounds too intimidating to R lovers, they might feel right at home by using the Python datatable package. It was inspired by its R namesake and written solely to deal with the massive datasets of today. It has the ability to read and manipulate gigabyte-sized datasets in mere seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common use-case is to read a large dataset with datatable and convert it to Pandas DataFrame format which is much faster than reading it purely with Pandas (Pandas is only fast for small-to-medium sized datasets). But, as an R user, you don't even have to do that as datatable has almost the same syntax as the data.table package of R. "

Another advantage of cuDF is that it has very similar syntax as Pandas. "

    "Matplotlib is one of the first libraries people are introduced to when they start learning data science in Python. It is one of the rare libraries that manage to keep complexity and flexibility in the perfect balance. In other words, it is easy enough to learn and create great charts for beginners while also having all the tools to create [truly amazing custom plots](https://ibexorigin.medium.com/yes-these-unbelievable-masterpieces-are-created-with-matplotlib-b62e0ff2d1a8) for experienced folks. \n",

It is a wrapper API around Matplotlib that makes it considerably easier to use for beginners. More importantly, it places great emphasis on making the plots as pretty as possible without tweaking them much. Seaborn also introduces new plot types and subplotting tools that aren't easily available in Matplotlib. "

The head of this family is, of course, Plotly, which has deep roots in R as well. It is great to produce high-quality charts out of the box and provides interfaces to customize and create complex charts. If you are unsure to choose between Matplotlib and Plotly, here is a [detailed comparison article](https://towardsdatascience.com/matplotlib-vs-plotly-lets-decide-once-and-for-all-dc3eca9aa011?gi=a7131eddc342). Altair and Bokeh both deserve a mention here as they have their own fanbase because of their unique look and syntax. "
