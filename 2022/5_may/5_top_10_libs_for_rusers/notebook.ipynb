    "R has a rich ecosystem of data manipulation libraries. Be it dplyr, tidyr, or data.table, R users don't have much to complain about in this regard. However, they might consider switching to some Python alternatives for more flexibility, speed and more features. \n",
    "\n",
    "R users will find out that we, Python data scientists, totally revere the Pandas library. It is the king of data manipulation in the Python data science stack and is used by millions around the world. It has [over 20 million weekly downloads](https://pypistats.org/packages/pandas), making it one of the most popular Python packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "It offers such an extensive suite of functions and classes to work with data that you can barely scratch the surface even after using it for a couple of years. Pandas is also a keystone library in the ecosystem as many other dominant Python libraries are written so that their functionality aligns with Pandas' classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it is such a large library, it is dead simple to learn and master. By knowing a few classes and functions, you can perform complex analyses on any dataset. "

    "If Pandas sounds too intimidating to R lovers, they might feel right at home by using the Python datatable package. It was inspired by its R namesake and written solely to deal with the massive datasets of today. It has the ability to read and manipulate gigabyte-sized datasets in mere seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common use-case is to read a large dataset with datatable and convert it to Pandas DataFrame format which is much faster than reading it purely with Pandas (Pandas is only fast for small-to-medium sized datasets). But, as an R user, you don't even have to do that as datatable has almost the same syntax as the data.table package of R. "

    "As far as I know, GPU support isn't fantastic in R, so R users might finally want to try out some GPU power by using Python libraries. RapidsAI offers just that opportunity via the cuDF library. cuDF is a dataframe library to manipulate datasets with billions of rows by tapping into the computing power of NVIDIA GPUs. Another advantage of cuDF is that it has very similar syntax as Pandas. "
