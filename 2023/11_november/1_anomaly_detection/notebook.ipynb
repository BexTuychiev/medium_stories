    "Shaq O'Neal, four times NBA winner, gets traded from the Miami Heat to the Phoenix Suns. When Shaq arrives at the apartment provided by the Phoenix Suns, he finds that it is empty. Without waiting for his belongings to arrive from Miami, he goes to Walmart and makes the biggest purchase in Walmart history for 70.000$ to furnish his apartment. Or at least, he tries, because his card gets declined twice.\n",

    "Anomaly detection encompasses two broad practices: outlier detection and novelty detection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers are abnormal or extreme data points that exist only in training data. In contrast, novelties refer to new or previously unseen instances in the original (training) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset of daily temperatures in a city. Most days, the temperatures range between 20°C and 30°C. However, one day, there's a spike of 40°C. This extreme temperature is an outlier as it significantly deviates from the usual daily temperature range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine that the city installs a new, more accurate weather monitoring station. As a result, the dataset starts consistently recording slightly higher temperatures, ranging from 25°C to 35°C. This sustained increase in temperatures is a __novelty__, representing a new pattern introduced by the improved monitoring system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomalies, on the other hand, is a broad term that refers to both outliers and novelties. It can be used to define any abnormal instance in any context."
