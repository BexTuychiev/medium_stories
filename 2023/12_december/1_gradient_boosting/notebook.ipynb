    "The body of this article is long (but highly-educational) so, we will make the intro as short as possible, directly starting with the question \"Why bother with gradient boosting?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of excellent reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gradient boosting is the best**: its accuracy and performance is unmatched for tabular supervised-learning tasks. \n",
    "2. **Gradient boosting is highly versatile**: it can be used in many important tasks such as regression, classification, ranking and survival analysis.\n",
    "3. **Gradient boosting is interpretable**: unlike many black-box algorithms like neural networks, gradient boosting does not sacrifice interpretability for performance. It works like a Swiss watch and yet, with patience, you can teach how it works to a school kid. \n",
    "4. **Gradient boosting is well-implemented**: it is not one of those algorithms that have little practical value. Various libraries like XGBoost and LightGBM in Python are used by hundreds of thousands of people.\n",
    "5. **Gradient boosting wins**: since 2015, professionals use it to consistently win tabular competitions on platforms like Kaggle. \n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these points are even remotely appealing, it would be worth to continue reading this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's get started!"

    "Boosting is a powerful **ensemble learning** technique in machine learning. Unlike traditional models that learn from the data independently, boosting combines the predictions of multiple **weak learners** to create a single, more accurate **strong learner**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I just wrote a bunch of new terms, so let me explain each, starting with weak learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "A weak learner is a machine learning model that is slightly better than a random guessing model. For example, let's say we are classifying mushrooms into edible and inedible. Our random guessing model performs with an accuracy of 40%. In this context, a weak learner would be a model that performs a bit better, maybe 50-60% accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "What boosting does is that it combines dozens or hundreds of these weak learners to build a final strong learner that is easily capable of reaching over 95% accuracy on the same problem. This indicates that all implementations of gradient boosting are ensemble learning techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular choice for a weak learner is a decision tree. Decision trees are weak enough to be used in gradient boosting but flexible enough to find patterns in all kinds of datasets. If you are not familiar with decision trees, I recommend [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L39rN6gz7Y&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer) by StatQuest and [this DataCamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/decision-tree-classification-python)."
