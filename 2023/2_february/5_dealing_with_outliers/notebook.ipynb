    "One of the most frequent causes of outliers is human and equipment errors. Someone screws up the number of zeros, press the wrong key, forget to measure something (or measure it twice), or a faulty instrument produces inconsistent readings, a software glitch records incorrect data and so on. \n",

    "As a data scientist, these are the things that are out of your control as they usually happen during data collection. The first appropriate course of action is try to correct these faulty anomalies. Try to fix that typo or change numeric values to common sense alternatives (like when someone is 200 years old in a survey, you change it to 20).\n",
