    "After failing to realize any of my New Year's resolutions since I was 16, I found that the best way to build a streak and a momentum for a new habit is starting small and slow. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you get the traditional \"start small\" advice, you almost always mistake how small. Since your idea of progress was a few hours, your \"small\" becomes half an hour or an hour,  which as we agreed (I hope), is too intensive for the fragile self-discipline of the 21st century. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you start less than half an hour, you increase your commitment too fast, which again leads to early quits. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, I made a list of resolutions this year, and I started doing them all for 5 minutes a day. The hardest part in the beginning was telling motivation to \"shut up\", because it kept egging me on \"doing it more\". I certainly could do it more, but I knew that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the tasks I've set after a few days. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sure enough, after the New-Year-Resolutions vibe passed, my motivation went with it. But this time, I stuck to all ten of my resolutions and have been doing them without missing a day (almost 90-day streak!). \n",
    "\n",
    "My approach was to start 5 minutes a day from January 1 (or even 2.5 for very tedious habits, like learning R) and increment by 2.5 minutes every Monday. \n",
    "\n",
    "This worked wonders! As you do the math, in 12 weeks, you reach a 30-minute daily goal, which was the case for most of my habits. \n",
    "\n",
    "After 4-6 weeks, I noticed that my chosen habits became such a routine part of my life that I could confidently increment my daily goal by 5 or even 10 minutes every week (one of my habits take 85 minutes each day now). And I don't see myself quitting them any time soon. "
