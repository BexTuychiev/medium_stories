    "You might already be able to draw a distinction between absolute and relative paths but I wanted to reiterate as it is crucial to understand the PATH variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "An absolute path provides the complete and precise location of a file or a directory within a file system. It starts from the root directory of the file system and includes all the necessary directories to reach the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS), an absolute path begins with a forward slash (\"/\"), such as `\"/home/user/source/script.py\"`. In Windows, an absolute path typically starts with a drive letter and a colon followed by backslashes, such as `\"C:\\Users\\User\\source\\script.py\"` (don't you hate that they are different?).\n",
    "\n",
    "A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory or another reference point. It does not start from the root directory but provides a path starting from a certain point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative paths are shorter and more flexible. They are typically used within a specific context or when referring to files or directories relative to the current working directory. In Unix-like systems, a relative path may look like `\"source/script.py\"`, assuming the current working directory is \"`/home/user/\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows systems, a relative path might be `\"source\\script.py\"` from the current working directory. The reference point for a relative path can vary, such as the current directory, a parent directory (\"..\"), or any other directory within the file system hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an analogy, absolute path is like receiving step-by-step directions to a store starting from the mall's entrance, specifying each turn and landmark along the way. A relative path, on the other hand, is like getting directions to a store based on your current location inside the mall, using nearby references and a shorter set of instructions. "
