    "According to TIOBE index, which has been ranking programming languages for over two decades, Java has always been one of the four most popular languages in the world. So many new \"This is the Java replacer\" languages have come and go but it is still going strong, even in 2024. If you search for jobs with the \"Java\" keyboard in the title, you are going to get more than 20 thousand hits in the US alone. Before you apply to any of them, you need to practice (cram) for interview questions about Java. \n",

    "The questions and answers listed in this article will help developers of all levels. Even seniors may benefit from reading answers to beginner-level questions because the ability to write stellar software is completely different from the ability to explain it to others. \n",

    "The questions are grouped by experience level and can apply to developers in the following roles:\n",
    "- Java software engineers or developers\n",
    "- Backend developers focusing on Java-based systems\n",

    "Answer: Fail-fast iterators throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is modified while iterating. Examples include iterators of `ArrayList` and `HashMap`.

    "Answer: Since Java 8, interfaces can have default and static methods with implementations. Abstract classes can have instance variables and constructors, while interfaces can only have static final variables. A class can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one abstract class. Choose abstract classes for defining a base class in a hierarchy, and interfaces for defining a contract for unrelated classes.\n",

    "   \n",
    "Answer: Objects that are equal according to `equals()` must return the same hash code. If you override `equals()`, you should also override `hashCode()` to maintain this contract. Failing to do so can lead to unexpected behavior in hash-based collections like `HashMap` and `HashSet`.\n",

    "   - Static method reference: `Math::max`\n",

    "   \n",
    "Answer: The `volatile` keyword ensures that changes to a variable are always visible to other threads. It establishes a happens-before relationship, meaning that any write to a volatile variable is visible to any subsequent read of the same variable. This is useful for flag variables in multi-threaded scenarios but doesn't provide atomicity for compound actions.\n",

In Java, this can be implemented using the `java.util.Observable` class and the `java.util.Observer` interface, although these are deprecated since Java 9. Alternatively, you can use the `PropertyChangeListener` and `PropertyChangeSupport` classes for a more modern approach.\n",

    "    \n",
    "Answer: `Comparable` is used to define a natural ordering for a class and is implemented by the class itself. `Comparator` is used to define custom orderings and is implemented as a separate class. Use `Comparable` for the default sorting behavior of a class, and `Comparator` when you need multiple ways to sort objects or when you can't modify the original class.\n",

    "    \n",
    "Answer: Try-with-resources is a language construct introduced in Java 7 that automatically closes resources that implement `AutoCloseable`. It simplifies resource management and helps prevent resource leaks. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"file.txt\"))) {\n",

    "Answer: Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (compile-time polymorphism). Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method defined in its superclass (runtime polymorphism). Both contribute to polymorphism by allowing different method implementations to be used based on context.\n",

    "Answer: Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time and must be either caught or declared. They're typically used for recoverable conditions. Unchecked exceptions (runtime exceptions) don't require explicit handling. They're typically used for programming errors. Use checked exceptions for conditions a well-written application should anticipate and recover from, and unchecked exceptions for programming errors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer: Reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm focused on data streams and the propagation of change. In Java, it's often implemented using libraries like RxJava or Project Reactor. It differs from imperative programming by emphasizing the flow of data and reactions to events, rather than sequential execution of commands. This can lead to more scalable and responsive systems, especially for I/O-bound applications.\n",

    "Answer: ConcurrentHashMap uses a segmented structure, dividing the map into segments that can be locked independently. It uses CAS operations for updates when possible, reducing contention. For read operations, it doesn't use locks at all, allowing for high concurrency. The internal structure has evolved over different Java versions to improve performance and reduce memory footprint.\n",

Off-heap memory is useful for large datasets that don't fit in the heap, to reduce GC pressure, or for memory-mapped files. It requires careful management as it's not automatically garbage collected.\n",
