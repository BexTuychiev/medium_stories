So many new \"This is the Java replacer\" languages have come and go but it is still going strong, even in 2024. If you search for jobs with the \"Java\" keyboard in the title, you are going to get more than 20 thousand hits in the US alone. Before you apply to any of them, you need to practice (cram) for interview questions on Java. \n",

    "The questions and answers listed in this article will help developers of all levels. Even seniors may benefit from reading answers to beginner-level questions because the ability to write stellar software is completely different from the ability to explain it to others. \n",

Declaring static members allows sharing data across all instances of a class, creating utility methods that don't require object instantiation or defining constraints. \n",

    "Arrays are critical objects that store multiple values of the same type in Java. They are created using square brackets and can be initialized in several ways. Here is a couple of common patterns:\n",

    "`break` and `continue` are important loop flow control keywords in Java. `break` statement is used to stop the entire loop immediately and ignore the rest of the loop. It is useful to terminate the loop early based on a condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I use `break` for debugging purposes like running only a single iteration of a long loop. \n",

    "`continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and immediately jumps to the next iteration. It is useful when looping over sequences and want to skip certain elements based on a condition. \n",

    "### 11. What is method overloading in Java?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Method overloading is a powerful technique that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This gives the objects of the class to handle closely-related (almost same) tasks but with different inputs. \n",
    "\n",

    "        return a + b;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the Calculator class has two add methods: One that takes two integers and returns an integer sum, and another that takes two doubles and returns a double sum. The method name is the same, but the parameters differ, allowing the appropriate method to be called based on the argument types."

    "One annoying limitation of Java's built-in array objects is that their size can't be changed after initialization. `ArrayList` solves this problem and offers more methods for manipulation.

    "    \n",
