    "Comparing programming languages is always a touchy subject among developers. While you could have a _ahem_ civilized discussion about the differences between R and Python, that may not be the case for Python and Java. Both languages have rich and similar growth histories and are often the first programming language that many developers learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "When these two or any other language is concerned, it is hard to find unbiased opinions and this article won't be an exception. Since I am a Pythonista, Java developers may not agree with some of the differences I share in terms of ease of use, syntax and readability. \n",
