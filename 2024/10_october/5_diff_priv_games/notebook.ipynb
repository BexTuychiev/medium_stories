    "Differential privacy has become a standard framework for applying strict individual privacy protection. It provides a controlled way to ingest calibrated noise into sensitive datasets so that any statistical analyses conducted on them are in line with current legal demands like GDPR or CCPA. The core idea behind DP is that the addition or removal of any individual from a sensitive dataset should not significantly affect the result of an analysis. This feature provides a strong privacy guarantee, allowing analysts and scientists to prevent linkage attacks, which is crucial in many domains such as research, medicine, census and finance. In this tutorial, we will explore how this mathematical framework works, how to implement it and important related ideas. "

    "Differential privacy uses randomized computations to preserve individual privacy. This means that every time you print a differentially private mean (or other statistic) of a dataset, you get a different result each time that is close to the _true mean_. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make each result truly irreversible, DP introduces a calibrated noise drawn from a probability distribution, typically the Laplace distribution. The drawn noise is large enough to mask the presence or absence of any single individual in the dataset, but small enough to maintain the utility of the data for analysis purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why would we even feel the need to hide such basic information? \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a medical study about a rare disease, if an attacker knows the total count and can find out that it increased by one after a specific person joined the study, they could infer that person's medical condition. Or in a salary database, if an attacker knows the mean salary before and after a new employee joins, they could potentially calculate that individual's exact salary. Another example is in voting data: if the mean age of voters in a small district is known, and then changes slightly after one person votes, their age and voting status could be deduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of DP is to apply a randomized mechanism to all computations performed on a sensitive dataset so that the probability of any result occurring is nearly identical for any two datasets that differ in only one record."

    "In the last section, we mentioned that DP injects noise drawn from probability distributions into datasets. The amount of noise should be carefully calibrated to maintain the usability of data. For example, if a _true count_ of samples in a dataset is 1000, the private count cannot be too far, like 1500, because it would make the statistic useless. So, to control the amount of this noise, DP uses two components: __sensitivity of a function and __epsilon hyperparameter__. \n",
    "\n",
    "Function sensitivity is the maximum amount the function output can change if a single unit is added or removed from the input dataset. For example, the sensitivity of a counter function is 1 because removing a single row from a dataset changes the counter's output by only 1. This concept is critical in DP because sensitivity determines how much noise should be added to a dataset. The larger the sensitivity, the more noise must be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sensitivity alone isn't enough because we need _epsilon_ to control the privacy-utility tradeoff. If we only use sensitivity to add noise, we would always add the same fixed amount of noise regardless of privacy needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, different scenarios require different privacy needs. For a low-stakes nation-wide public survey, we might be okay with less privacy, adding minimal noise. For sensitive medical data, we need stronger privacy, requiring more noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "DP combines sensitivity and epsilon in such a way that lower epsilon increases the noise while higher epsilon lowers it. For example, with epsilon=1, a counter function might add noise ±2-3 to the true count. But with epsilon=0.1 (stronger privacy), it might add noise ±20-30. Epsilon gives us this crucial flexibility to tune privacy protection based on context."
