    "PyTorch is a massively popular Python framework used to create deep learning models and neural networks. It was originally developed by Facebook's AI Research Lab (FAIR) and evolved from an earlier Lua framework. Even though its first public release was in 2017, it became the most popular deep learning framework in 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why PyTorch became so widespread:\n",
    "1. __Python-first philosophy__: Deep integration with Python made it more accessible to developers.\n",
    "2. __Research Community Adoption__: Scientists in academia came up with cool prototypes in research using PyTorch, some of those prototypes became wildly successful, which in turn, attracted more people outside the academia to PyTorch.\n",
    "3. __Industry support__: PyTorch is officially backed by multi-billion companies like Facebook/Meta, Microsoft and Amazon. \n",
    "4. __Strong ecosystem__: It has a rich library of tools, extensions, pre-trained models and often inspires other related projects like PyTorch Lightning {link an article here}. \n",
    "5. __Dynamic computation graphs__: Unlike TensorFlow's (PyTorch's main competitor) initial static graphs, PyTorch's dynamic computation approach made debugging much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all these features and aspects, PyTorch became the primary framework for many leading AI research papers. It now powers many popular AI applications and services in companies like Tesla, Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta."
