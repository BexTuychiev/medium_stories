    "First, there were data warehouses. They stored data in rows and columns because all the Internet and computers of the time were capable of distributing was simple text information. Much later came data lakes - they could store nearly any type of data you could collect. They were great for the social media and YouTube age. \n",
    "\n",
    "But they both had disadvantages - data warehouses were expensive and unsuitable for modern data science while data lakes were messy and often turned into data swamps. So, companies started having two separate tech stacks - warehouses for BI and analytics, lakes for machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "But managing two different data architectures was such a pain that companies often had poor results. This issue gave rise to the __lakehouse architecture__, which is precisely what Databricks is famous for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks is a cloud-based platform that allows users to derive value from both warehouses and lakes in a unified environment. This article will give overview of the platform, showing its most important features and how to use them."
