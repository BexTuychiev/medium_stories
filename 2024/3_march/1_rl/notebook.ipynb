    "In the beginning, this agent has no idea of what the controls are, how to progress through the game, what the obstacles are or what finishes the game. The agent learns all these things without any human intervention - all through the power of reinforcement learning algorithms. \n",

    "RL agents excel in situations where traditional machine learning algorithms struggle. They can solve problems without predefined solutions or explicitly programmed actions and most importantly, without mounds and mounds of data. That's why RL is having significant impact on many fields. For instance, it's used in:\n",
