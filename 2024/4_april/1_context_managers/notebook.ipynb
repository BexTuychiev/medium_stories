The `__enter__` method is called when you enter the `with` block, and its return value is assigned to a variable within that block.  The `__exit__` method, on the other hand, is called when the `with` block exits, regardless of whether it finishes normally or with an exception."

    "\n",
    "1. File Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the classic example of opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "  data = file.read()\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Crucially, the `__exit__` method of the file object is guaranteed to be called when the `with` block exits, even if an exception occurs.  This method takes care of closing the file, ensuring you don't leave open file handles lying around."

When you enter the `with` block, the `__enter__` method acquires the lock, ensuring only one thread can execute the critical section at a time.  Finally, the `__exit__` method releases the lock upon exiting the with block, allowing other threads to proceed."
