    "Dijkastra's is the go-to algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points in a network, which has many applications. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GPS navigation systems finding the fastest route\n",
    "- Routing data packets in computer networks\n",
    "- Delivery services optimizing routes for efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a fundamental algorithm in computer science and graph theory. Understanding and learning to implement it opens doors to more advanced graph algorithms and applications. It also teaches a valuable problem-solving approach through its greedy algorithm, which involves making the optimal choice at each step based on current information. This skill is transferable to other optimization algorithms. Dijkastra's algorithm may not be the most efficient in all scenarios but it can be a good baseline when solving \"shortest distance\" problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond just finding the shortest physical distance, it can also be used in cases such as:\n",
    "- Social networks (suggesting connections)\n",
    "- Finance (finding optimal investment paths)\n",
    "- Project management (finding the most efficient workflow)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you aren't interested in any of these things, implementing Dijkastra's algorithm in Python will teach you valuable skills as we will use a combination of:\n",
    "- Python classes\n",
    "- Dictionary and list comprehensions\n",
    "- Priority queues\n",
    "- The `networkx` library for graph manipulation\n",
    "- Creating animations as GIFs\n",
