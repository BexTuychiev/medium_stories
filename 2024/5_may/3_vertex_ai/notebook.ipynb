    "Even though most people associate search engines with Google, the company has deep roots in the data science industry. It consistently delivers state-of-the-art products and solutions aimed at getting the most benefit from data. One of their products, Vertex AI, was released in 2021 to simplify the machine learning process at enterprise scale.\n",

    "A typical machine learning life cycle consists of many stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data preparation, ingestion, exploration\n",
    "- Feature engineering, selection\n",
    "- Model training and tuning\n",
    "- Deploying and model monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "All these stages and sub-stages require different set of tools and diverse team of experts to coordinate them. Vertex AI by Google Cloud streamlines and unifies this entire process into a single platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "While large-scale ML applications require seasoned specialists, Vertex AI empowers users of any skill level:\n",
    "- __AutoML for beginners__: Requires no coding experience! Simply feed your data and with a few clicks, AutoML generates a high quality model for you. All the heavy lifting of data preparation, model building including algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning is performed under the hood.\n",
    "- __Custom model training for experts__: Your experience is the limit. For experienced data scientists and ML engineers, Vertex AI provides the flexibility to train models using their preferred framework such as PyTorch, TensorFlow or XGBoost.\n",
    "- __Deployment for everyone__: Once you have a model trained by either AutoML or a custom one, Vertex AI makes deploying them a breeze. You can publish models as real-time APIs to integrate into your products or use batch-prediction for large-scale tasks.\n",

    "There are many things we aren't mentioning in this section, as you will get to work on most of them yourself in this tutorial. "
