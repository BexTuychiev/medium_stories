    "Would you believe me if I said there isn't a single enterprise Business Intelligence (BI) tool powered solely by AI on the Internet? Of course, there are websites that claim to be \"AI-powered data analysis platforms\" but they are just wrapping OpenAI API with a fancy UI and a bit of prompt engineering. Besides, they have a huge disadvantage - you cannot use those tools in enterprise scenarios because policies don't permit uploading company data to external servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's why we've built Vizly - a platform to analyze your data by asking questions in natural language instead of using BI tools that take months to master. You can access Vizly as a single user through the website or its enterprise version can be deployed on-premises without exposing sensitive company data to external APIs.\n",
