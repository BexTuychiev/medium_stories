    " Machine learning projects don't end when you deploy your best trained model into production. Even after deployment, you must monitor it constantly to ensure its accuracy doesn't go down over time. This is where tools like Grafana can be helpful with its powerful visualization and monitoring capabilities. It allows data scientists and ML engineers keep a close eye on their production model's performance.\n",

    " This article aims to introduce you to the world of machine learning model monitoring through Grafana using the example of a simple regression model. By the end, we will have a monitoring system set up that can send alerts when production performance drops. \n",
