    " Machine learning projects don't end when you deploy your best trained model into production. Even after deployment, you must monitor it constantly to ensure its accuracy doesn't go down over time. This is where tools like Grafana can be helpful with its powerful visualization and monitoring capabilities. It allows data scientists and ML engineers keep a close eye on their production model's performance.\n",

    "Imagine you've trained a robot to sort apples based on their size and color. The robot can detect ripe red apples of certain size range. Now, let's say next year, the orchard starts producing new type of apples that are green when they are ripe. Suddenly, the robot starts making mistakes because the data it is receiving (green apples) is different from what it was trained on (red apples). \n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon is called __data drift__ in machine learning. It happens when the distribution of production data differs significantly from the training data. This often leads to horrible model performance because it is making predictions on new type of data that involves outdated or irrelevant patterns. \n",

    "Both data drift and concept drift highlight the importance of continuous monitoring in machine learning. Models that perform well in training and initial deployment can degrade over time as the world around them changes. By implementing robust monitoring systems we can:\n",

    "1. Detect changes early.\n",
    "2. Understand the nature of the drift.\n",
    "3. Take appropriate actions such as retraining the model or updating our features. \n",

    "That's why we need tools like Grafana that provide us methods to visualize these drifts and set up alerts when our model's performance starts to go down.\n",
