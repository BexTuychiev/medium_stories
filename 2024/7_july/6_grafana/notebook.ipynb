Even after deployment, you must monitor it constantly to ensure its accuracy doesn't go down over time. This is where tools like Grafana can be helpful with its powerful visualization and monitoring capabilities. It allows data scientists and ML engineers keep a close eye on their production model's performance.\n",

    "Imagine you've trained a robot to sort apples based on their size and color. The robot can detect ripe red apples of certain size range. Now, let's say next year, the orchard starts producing new type of apples that are green when they are ripe. Suddenly, the robot starts making mistakes because the data it is receiving (green apples) is different from what it was trained on (red apples). \n",

This often leads to horrible model performance because it is making predictions on new type of data that involves outdated or irrelevant patterns. \n",
