    "LangChain's 90k GitHub stars is all the credibility it needs - right now, it is the hottest framework to build LLM-based applications. Its comprehensive set of tools and components allows you to build end-to-end AI solutions using almost any LLM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps, at the heart of LangChain's capabilities are LangChain Agents. These agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous tools that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with other tools and APIs. They represent a significant leap forward in automating complex workflows with LLMs. \n",

    "- A weather API\n",

    "- User preferences database\n",

    "2. Input weather data into ML Clothing Model\n",

    "Each chain solves a specific problem, using a predetermined sequence of steps and a subset of the available tools. They cannot adapt beyond their defined scope. They also require three separate branches of development, which is inefficient in terms of time and resources.\n",

    "1. Understand user's query or problem\n",
    "2. Assess which tools are relevant to the problem\n",
    "3. Dynamically create a workflow using the most appropriate tools\n",
    "4. Execute the workflow, making real-time adjustments if needed\n",
    "5. Evaluate the outcome and learn for future interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a user asks \"What should I wear for my bike ride today?\", the agent might check the weather API, analyze suitable biking routes through Strava, recommend appropriate clothing considering user's past preferences and generate a personalized response. \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent can:\n",
    "- Handle a wide variety of problems using the same set of tools\n",
    "- Create custom workflows for each unique situation\n",
    "- Adapt its approach based on the specific context and user needs\n",
