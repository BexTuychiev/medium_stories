    "Have you ever tried navigating your way down a hilly area blindfolded? That's somewhat analogous to what machine learning models do when they are trying to improve. They continually search for the lowest point (best solution) without really seeing the whole picture. This is where optimization algorithms come in handy, and ADAM is like the smart flashlight in this journey. \n",

    "ADAM, short for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a popular optimization technique, especially in deep learning. In this article, you'll see why this is the case. We will cover the intuition behind it, dive into some math (don't worry, we will keep it friendly), its Python implementation and how to use it in PyTorch. "

    "The popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning and, most often, in deep learning is called ADAM, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "ADAM combines ideas from two other robust optimization techniques: momentum and RMSprop. It is named _adaptive_ as it adjusts the learning rate for each parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are its key features and advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaptivity: ADAM adapts the learning rate for each parameter, which can speed up learning in many cases.\n",
    "- Momentum: It uses a form of momentum, helping it navigate complex surfaces such as ravines and saddle points more effectively.\n",
    "- Bias correction: ADAM includes bias correction terms, which help it perform well even in the initial stages of training.\n",
    "- Computational efficiency: It's relatively computationally efficient and has low memory requirements.\n",
    "- Hyperparameter robustness: While the learning rate may need tuning, ADAM is often less sensitive to hyperparameter choices than some other optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, ADAM makes models learn more efficiently by continuously adjusting the learning rate of each parameter and, as a consequence, tends to converge much more quickly than standard stochastic gradient descent. For many deep learning applications, it is therefore a strong default choice."
