    "Today’s large language models have access to an ever-growing amount of information. However, there remains a vast trove of private data that these models do not tap into. This is why one of the most popular applications of LLMs in enterprise settings is retrieval-augmented generation—RAG for short. At Vizly, our AI-powered data analysis platform, we have gained valuable insights into building effective RAG systems. In this tutorial, we will share some of our learnings and show you how to create your own RAG system. \n",

    "\n",
    "A first-year college student, Chandler, is considering skipping a few classes but wants to ensure he isn’t violating the university attendance policy. Like with anything these days, he asks ChatGPT the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, ChatGPT can’t answer it. The chatbot isn’t dumb — it just doesn’t have access to Chandler’s university documents. So, Chandler finds the policy document himself and discovers that it is a long, technical read he doesn’t want to wade through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, he gives the entire document to ChatGPT and asks the question again. This time, he gets his answer.\n",
    "This is an individual case of retrieval-augmented generation. The language model’s answer (generation) is augmented (enriched) by context retrieved from a source not part of its original training.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scalable version of a RAG system would be able to answer any student question by searching university documents itself, finding the relevant ones, and retrieving chunks of text that most likely contain the answer.\n",
    "Generally speaking, in a RAG system, you retrieve information from a private data source and feed it to a language model, enabling the model to give a contextually relevant answer. "

It takes the reader through the whole process, from setting up an environment and processing documents to building a RAG chain and deploying a friendly web app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important points include: \n",
    "- RAG for a smarter (in the external knowledge sense) language model\n",
    "- RAG chains can be built using LangChain, OpenAI's models, and third-party community integrations.\n",
    "- The app can be made interactive using Streamlit and be deployed for public use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project forms the basis for applications that are more advanced. It can be extended in significant ways, such as the incorporation of multiple document types, improved retrieval accuracy, and features like document summarization. And yet, what it really serves is as a demonstration of the potential power of these technologies, individually and combined. "
