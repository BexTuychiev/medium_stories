    "Even though the amount of information today's LLMs have access is growing constantly, there are mounds of private data not included in their training. For this reason, one of the most popular applications of LLMs in enterprise settings is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). When you design a RAG system, you retrieve information from a private data source and feed it to a language model to generate contextually relevant responses. \n",

    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to develop RAG applications using a massively popular framework - LangChain. I'll guide you through the process step-by-step, from setting up your environment to implementing the core components of a RAG system. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created your own chatbot capable of answering questions using any outside source, opening up a world of possibilities for leveraging private data in your AI applications.\n",
