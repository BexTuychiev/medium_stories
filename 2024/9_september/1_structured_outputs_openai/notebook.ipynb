With Structured Outputs, as the name suggests, you can ensure LLMs will generate responses only in a format you specify. This capability will make it significantly easier to build applications that require precise data formatting. In this tutorial, you will learn how to get started with this new feature, understand its new syntax and explore its key applications."
