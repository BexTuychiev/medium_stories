    "Data scientists start learning about SQL from the cradle. That's understandable given the ubiquity and high usefulness of tabular information. However, there are other successful database formats like graph databases to store connected data that don't fit into a relational SQL database. In this tutorial, we will learn about Neo4j, a popular graph database management system, to create, manage and query graph databases in Python. "

    "Before we start talking all about Neo4j, let's take a moment to understand graph databases better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases are a type of NoSQL databases (don't use SQL) designed for managing connected data. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, graph databases use graph structures that are made up of:\n",
    "- __Nodes (entities)__ such as people, places, concepts\n",
    "- __Edges (relationships)__ that connect different nodes like _person_ LIVES IN _a place_, or _a football player_ SCORED IN _a match_. \n",
    "- __Properties (attributes for nodes/edges)__ like the age of a person, or when in the match the goal was scored.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure makes graph databases ideal for handling interconnected data in fields and applications such as social networks, recommendations, fraud detection, etc. often outperforming relation DBs in terms of querying efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the very basics out of the way, let's see how Neo4j implements these concepts and why it has become the most popular graph DB management system."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Neo4j, the leading name in the world of graph DB management, is known for its powerful features and versatility. \n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, Neo4j uses native graph storage highly optimized to carry out graph operations. Its efficiency in handling complex relations makes it outperform traditional databases for connected data. Neo4j's scalability is truly impressive: it can handle billions of nodes and relationships with ease, making it suitable for both small projects and large enterprises. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another key aspect of Neo4j is data integrity. It ensures full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, providing reliability and consistency in transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of transactions, its query language, Cypher, offers a very intuitive and declarative syntax designed for graph patterns. For this reason, its syntax has been dubbed with the \"ASCII art\" nickname. Cypher will be no problem to learn, especially if you are familiar with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Cypher, it is to add new nodes, relationships or properties without worrying about existing queries or schema. It is adaptable to changing requirements of modern development environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j has a vibrant ecosystem support. It has extensive documentation, comprehensive tools to visualize graphs, active community and integrations with other programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript."
