    "Ever wondered why everyone codes in English? Why not in Chinese or Russian or Klingon or in ancient Farsi? Actually, does the coding language matter? Well, no. Every source code, regardless of the language, is converted into a machine language ONLY computer can work with. So the underlying truth why all programming languages use English keywords is that it is the global language and understood by billions. Writing source codes in English makes it easier for humans to create computer programs and collaborate with other programmers across the globe. It all comes down to writing understandable code. \n",
