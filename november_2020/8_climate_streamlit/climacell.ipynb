Install `requests`, get an API key and you were done. \n",

I spent around 3-4 hours experimenting with the library and reading the documentation cover-to-cover. And in a day, I was displaying the realtime temperatures of my hometown on a `plotly` ScatterMapbox on my Streamlit web-app. (More on that later). How crazy is that?\n",

    "The above function is a bit large, I even removed some parts for this article. After we get the country, a separate function will query the top 25 cities (maybe less, depends on the data) of the country based on population size and inserts it into the above function. Then, the function will use its `lat` and `lon` columns to make an API call. The API calls are made using an `apply` function which is much faster than `for` loops and more modular. \n",
