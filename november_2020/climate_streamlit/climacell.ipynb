    "About 3 days ago, I got introduced to a Weather API by Climacell. Unlike many other APIs I have faced, it was dead simple, had a generous free plan and there was absolutely no need for external packages/wrappers required (or building one in some cases). Install `requests`, get an API key and you were done. \n",

    "Turns out, this was a perfect learning opportunity for me. I have been putting off checking out Streamlit, which is all the hype now, and decided to use it for this project. I went over the documentation and before even trying out an example, I already fell in love with it. I spent around 3-4 hours experimenting with the library and reading the documentation cover-to-cover. And in a day, I was displaying the realtime temperatures of my hometown on a `plotly` ScatterMapbox on my Streamlit web-app. (More on that later). How crazy is that?\n",
