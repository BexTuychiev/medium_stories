    "The first mechanical clock was invented in the 17th century. During those times, everyone set their clock so that noon was directly overhead and this was not a big problem because everyone traveled on foot and horses. Later, telegraphs and trains were invented and you could suddenly travel around and communicate with people hundreds of miles away in a significantly short amount of time. This led to people realizing they had to have a standard time so, in the 1900s, the greatest leaders and thinkers from developed countries gathered around and divided the world into 24 time zones. \n",

This standardization is also knows as UTC (Universal Coordinate Time). In other words, if you Google 'UTC time now', it will show the time in London.\n",
