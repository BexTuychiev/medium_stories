    "The first mechanical clock was invented in the 17th century. During those times, everyone set their clock according to noon and this was not a big problem because everyone traveled on foot and horses. Later, telegraphs and trains were invented and you could suddenly travel around and communicate with people hundreds of miles away in a significantly short amount of time. This led to people to realize they had to have a standard time so, in 1900s, the greatest leaders and thinkers from developed countries gathered around and divided the world into 24 time zones. \n",

    "Greenwich, London got be 0 o'clock because they standardized their time first and the countries west to the UK had their clocks behind and the East countries were ahead of Greenwich time. This standardization is knows as UTC (Universal Coordinate Time). \n",
    "In other words, if you Google 'UTC time now', it will show the time in London.\n",
